# Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning
## Overview
This project applies Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to predict customer churn based on demographic and usage data. It includes data preprocessing, feature encoding, scaling, model training, and performance evaluation.

This analysis was completed as part of a DataCamp machine learning project to strengthen proficiency in scikit-learn and classification modeling. (https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/1965)

## Project Objectives
- Preprocess and merge customer demographic and usage data.
- Apply one-hot encoding and feature scaling.
- Train and evaluate Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers.
- Compare model performance using classification reports, confusion matrices, and accuracy scores.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Files Included
- churn_prediction_ml_dc.ipynb – Main notebook with code and outputs
- README.md – Project overview and instructions
- telecom_demographics.csv – Contains customer demographic information including age, location, and tenure.
- telecom_usage.csv – Includes usage patterns such as call minutes, data usage, and whether the customer churned.

## How to Run
- Clone the repository
- Open churn_prediction_ml_dc.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook
- Run all cells to reproduce the analysis

## Results Summary
- Random Forest achieved higher accuracy than Logistic Regression.
- Model evaluation included confusion matrices and classification metrics.
